# Recommendation Engine Audit - Executive Summary

## Audit Complete ‚úÖ

**Date**: September 19, 2025  
**Scope**: Full audit of Recommendation Engine (wizard, inline AI help, rules, results, no-match, freshness)  
**Status**: Comprehensive analysis completed with implementation roadmap

## Key Findings

### System Maturity: 70% Complete ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Strong Foundation Exists**:
- ‚úÖ Core scoring engine with HARD/SOFT rule classification
- ‚úÖ Wizard framework with survey/freetext modes  
- ‚úÖ Feature flag system with all required flags
- ‚úÖ Zero-match fallback with gap ticket creation
- ‚úÖ Results display with confidence scoring
- ‚úÖ Basic AI components (in plan editor)

**Critical Gaps Identified**:
- ‚ùå **Decision tree starts with program type** (conflicts with requirement)
- ‚ùå **AI help not inline with wizard** (only in plan editor)
- ‚ùå **Results lack human explanations** (technical scores vs plain language)
- ‚ùå **No data freshness system** (missing source register)
- ‚ùå **No performance monitoring** (P95 latency requirement)

## Implementation Priority Matrix

### üî¥ **Critical (Blocks User Experience)**
1. **Decision Tree Refactor** - Remove program type upfront selection
2. **Results Page Enhancement** - Human-readable "Why it fits" explanations
3. **Inline AI Helper** - Convert messy text to structured chips in wizard

### üü° **High (System Requirements)**
4. **Source Register System** - Data freshness tracking for top 20 AT programs
5. **Rule Traceability** - Complete persona decision traces
6. **Performance Monitoring** - P95 ‚â§ 2.5s latency tracking

### üü¢ **Medium (Polish & Validation)**
7. **QBank Integration** - "Proceed anyway" ‚Üí Editor with missing items
8. **AI Guardrails** - Program invention prevention, off-topic redirect
9. **Documentation** - Feature flags, route inventory

## Resource Allocation Recommendation

### Phase 1 (Weeks 1-4): User-Side Proofs
**Team**: 2 Frontend + 1 Full-Stack Developer  
**Focus**: Wizard refactor, AI integration, results enhancement

### Phase 2 (Weeks 5-8): System-Side Proofs  
**Team**: 1 Backend + 1 DevOps + 1 Full-Stack Developer  
**Focus**: Data systems, rule tracing, freshness monitoring

### Phase 3 (Weeks 9-12): Validation & Polish
**Team**: 1 QA + 1 Full-Stack Developer  
**Focus**: Testing, performance, documentation

## Business Impact Assessment

### User Experience Improvements
- **Wizard Flow**: Eliminates confusing program type selection upfront
- **AI Assistant**: Reduces user friction with intelligent help  
- **Results Clarity**: Non-technical users understand "why" recommendations fit
- **No-Match Handling**: Clear path forward when no perfect matches exist

### System Reliability Gains
- **Deterministic Logic**: Every decision traceable to specific rules
- **Data Freshness**: Automated monitoring of program source changes
- **Performance SLA**: Guaranteed ‚â§2.5s response times
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation with uncertainty management

### Technical Debt Reduction
- **Legacy Code**: Decision tree rebuilt from program rules (no hard-coding)
- **Monitoring**: Full observability of system performance
- **Documentation**: Complete route and feature flag inventory
- **Testing**: Comprehensive persona journey validation

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **High Risk Areas**
- **Decision Tree Refactor**: Core logic change affecting all users
  - *Mitigation*: Feature flags + comprehensive testing + gradual rollout

- **AI Integration**: Complex inline assistant with guardrails
  - *Mitigation*: Start simple (rule-based) ‚Üí enhance with LLM later

- **Performance Requirements**: 2.5s P95 on Vercel
  - *Mitigation*: Early performance monitoring + optimization focus

### ‚úÖ **Low Risk Areas**  
- Feature flag system already robust
- Basic components exist and work
- Team familiar with existing codebase

## Success Metrics

### User-Side Validation
- [ ] Demo: Wizard without program type ‚Üí program emerges as outcome
- [ ] Demo: AI converts "I run a bakery in Vienna" ‚Üí structured chips
- [ ] Screenshots: Result cards with % + human explanations
- [ ] Demo: No-match ‚Üí Nearest 3 + Proceed anyway ‚Üí Editor QBank

### System-Side Validation  
- [ ] Document: Before/after decision tree when rule edited
- [ ] Traces: 3 personas (inputs ‚Üí rules ‚Üí final % ‚Üí bullets)
- [ ] Table: Source register for top 20 AT programs + diff PR example
- [ ] Demo: Skip flow ‚Üí max 3 overlays ‚Üí QBank population

### Technical Validation
- [ ] Dashboard: P95 latency ‚â§ 2.5s 
- [ ] Documentation: All feature flags with current values
- [ ] Inventory: Active routes with legacy cleanup
- [ ] Tests: All acceptance criteria passing

## Recommended Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (This Week)
1. **Stakeholder Alignment**: Review audit findings and approve phases
2. **Team Assignment**: Allocate developers to Phase 1 tasks
3. **Environment Setup**: Prepare development/staging for wizard changes

### Month 1 Goals
1. **Working Wizard**: No program type upfront, AI helper integrated
2. **Enhanced Results**: Human explanations replacing technical scores
3. **Performance Baseline**: Monitoring system operational

### Month 2 Goals  
1. **Data Systems**: Source register tracking top 20 programs
2. **Rule Tracing**: Complete persona decision documentation
3. **Beta Testing**: User validation of new wizard flow

### Month 3 Goals
1. **Production Ready**: All acceptance criteria validated
2. **Documentation**: Complete system documentation
3. **Team Handoff**: Operations team trained on new systems

## Budget Impact

### Development Investment
- **Phase 1**: ~400 developer hours (4 weeks √ó 2.5 FTE)
- **Phase 2**: ~400 developer hours (4 weeks √ó 2.5 FTE) 
- **Phase 3**: ~200 developer hours (4 weeks √ó 1.25 FTE)
- **Total**: ~1000 developer hours over 12 weeks

### Operational Savings
- **Reduced Support**: Clearer explanations = fewer user questions
- **Automated Monitoring**: Data freshness bot reduces manual checking
- **Performance SLA**: Guaranteed user experience quality
- **Technical Debt**: Cleaner codebase = faster future development

## Conclusion

The Recommendation Engine has a **solid foundation** but needs **critical refinements** to meet the audit specification. The gaps are well-defined and addressable within a 12-week timeline. 

**Priority 1**: Fix the user experience issues (wizard flow, AI help, result explanations)  
**Priority 2**: Build the system integrity features (data freshness, rule tracing, monitoring)  
**Priority 3**: Polish and validate the complete solution

With proper resource allocation and phased execution, the system will meet all acceptance criteria and deliver a **deterministic, explainable, fresh, and simple** recommendation engine for non-technical users.
