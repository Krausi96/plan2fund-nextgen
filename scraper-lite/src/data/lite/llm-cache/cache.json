The program also seeks to steer and accelerate the transition to a low carbon, resource efficient circular economy and sustainable bioeconomy, including forestry. Research and innovation activities under Cluster 6 will contribute to the objectives of the European Green Deal, including the Biodiversity Strategy to 2030, the Farm to Fork strategy, the European Climate Pact, and initiatives under sustainable industry and eliminating pollution, as well as the long-term vision for rural areas and the Sustainable Development Goals.",
