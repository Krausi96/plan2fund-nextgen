## ⚠️ Issues Found

### 1. **Discovery Found 0 New Programs** ❌
**Problem:**
- Total links processed: 140
- Programs found: 0
- Already seen: 131/140 (93.7%)
- Different host: 8/140 (5.7%)
- **Acceptance rate: 0%**

**Root Cause:**
- Most URLs already in `state.seen` (5,658 URLs seen total)
- Need fresh seeds or reset seen URLs for new discovery
- Discovery depth may need adjustment

**Recommendation:**
- Reset `state.seen` for specific domains if re-discovering
- Or use different seed URLs
- Or increase `LITE_MAX_DISCOVERY_PAGES` to explore deeper

---

### 2. **Query Parameter URLs Being Scraped** ⚠️
**Problem:**
- URLs like `?type%5B0%5DD=news`, `?year%5B0%5DD=2025` are being scraped
- These are likely filter/listing pages, not program detail pages
- Extracting data from wrong pages

**Examples:**
- `https://www.ffg.at/en/node/202386?type%5B0%5DD=news`
- `https://www.ffg.at/en/node/202386?year%5B0%5DD=2025`
- `https://www.ffg.at/en/events?combine_ort%5B0%%5D=1`

**Current Filtering:**
- `isQueryListing()` checks for `field_`, `filter`, `name%5B`, `status%5B`
- **Missing**: `type%5B`, `year%5B`, `combine_` patterns

**Recommendation:**
- Enhance `isQueryListing()` to catch more query patterns
- Add: `type%5B`, `year%5B`, `combine_`, `page=`, `sort=`

---

### 3. **Contact Email Extraction Issues** ⚠️
**Problem:**
- Extracting invalid contacts:
  - `2022-2026` (date range, not email)
  - `24h-auskunft@aws.atQuestions` (email + trailing text)
  - `71ERC-PRESS@ec.europa.euMarcin` (email + trailing text)

**Root Cause:**
- Email regex not stopping at word boundaries properly
- Trailing text not cleaned correctly

**Current Code:**
```typescript
const tldMatch = email.match(/^(.+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.([a-z]{2,}))([^a-z0-9].*)?$/i);
if (tldMatch && tldMatch[1]) {
  return tldMatch[1]; // Should stop at TLD
}
```

**Recommendation:**
- Better cleaning: stop at first non-email character after TLD
- Validate: exclude dates (YYYY-YYYY pattern)
- Validate: exclude numbers that look like years

---

### 4. **Database Connection Not Set** ⚠️
**Problem:**
- All saves show: `DATABASE_URL environment variable is not set`
- Pages saved to JSON only, not database
- Can't use database quality scripts

**Recommendation:**
- Set `DATABASE_URL` in `.env.local`
- Or use JSON storage (current fallback is working)

---

### 5. **Existing Pages Missing New Fields** ℹ️
**Expected Behavior:**
- New pages (44 scraped) should have new fields
- Existing pages (144 total) don't have new fields yet
- Need to re-scrape existing pages

**Status:**
- ✅ New pages: Will have new fields automatically
- ⚠️ Existing pages: Need re-scraping

**Recommendation:**
- Run: `node scripts/manual/rescrape-pages.js` to update existing pages

---

## 📊 Statistics

### Discovery
- Total links processed: 140
- Programs found: 0 (already all seen)
- Queued for exploration: 0
- Already seen: 131 (93.7%)
- Different host: 8 (5.7%)

### Scraping
- Pages scraped this cycle: 44
- Total pages: 144
- Queued jobs remaining: 3,025
- Failed jobs: 3
- Success rate: ~93% (excluding already-seen URLs)

### Extraction Quality
- Deadline extraction: **23.3%** (improved from 7.6%)
- Smart discoveries: **Working in live test**
- Contact extraction: **Has issues** (needs fixing)

---

## 🔧 Fixes Applied ✅

### ✅ Priority 1: Fixed Query Parameter Filtering
**File:** `scraper-lite/src/utils.ts` → `isQueryListing()`

**Applied:** Enhanced to catch more patterns:
```typescript
export function isQueryListing(url: string): boolean {
  const lower = url.toLowerCase();
  if (!lower.includes('?')) return false;
  return /(filter|field_|search|suche|query|sort=|type%5B|year%5B|combine_|combine%5B|page=|offset=|limit=|year=|type=|category=)/.test(lower);
}
```

**Result:** Now filters out `?type%5B0%5DD=news`, `?year%5B0%5DD=2025`, `?combine_ort%5B0%%5D=1`, etc.

---

### ✅ Priority 2: Improved Contact Email Cleaning
**File:** `scraper-lite/src/extract.ts` → Email extraction

**Applied:**
- Enhanced cleaning: Better TLD boundary detection
- Exclude date ranges: Filters out `2022-2026` patterns
- Better trailing text removal: Handles `email@domain.comText` cases

**Result:** Now properly excludes dates and cleans trailing text

---

### ⚠️ Priority 3: Discovery State Management
**Status:** Needs manual action

**Recommendation:**
- Reset `state.seen` for specific domains if re-discovering
- Or use new seed URLs
- Or increase discovery depth/pages (`LITE_MAX_DISCOVERY_PAGES`)

---

## ✅ What's New (Smart Discoveries)

All new features are **working correctly** in live extraction:

1. ✅ **Structured Geography**: Extracting country, region separately
2. ✅ **Funding Type**: Auto-detecting from content (grant, loan, equity)
3. ✅ **Industries**: Detecting 5+ industries per page
4. ✅ **Technology Focus**: Detecting 7+ tech areas per page
5. ✅ **Program Topics**: Detecting 7+ topics per page
6. ✅ **Enhanced Deadlines**: 23.3% coverage (up from 7.6%)

**Note:** New fields will only appear in **newly scraped pages**. Existing pages need re-scraping.

---

## 📋 Next Steps

1. **Fix query parameter filtering** (Priority 1)
2. **Fix contact email extraction** (Priority 2)
3. **Re-scrape existing pages** to populate new fields
4. **Set DATABASE_URL** if using database
5. **Reset discovery state** for fresh URLs (optional)

---
