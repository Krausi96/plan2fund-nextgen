## üéØ **KEY GAPS & RECOMMENDATIONS**

### **‚ùå Missing Elements (Current State)**
1. **No Free Version** - No free tier or trial
2. **No Persona-Specific Pricing** - Generic pricing for all

## üìù **GPT PROMPT FOR ANALYSIS**

**TASK:** Analyze Plan2Fund's pricing and about pages and provide detailed design and architecture recommendations. The landing page is the source of truth and should NOT be changed.

**WHAT TO ANALYZE:**
1. **Current State**: Pricing page (3 products), About page (8 sections)
2. **Landing Page Reference**: Use landing page as source of truth for target groups and content
   - Standard version (`/`) with Solo-Entrepreneurs as default
   - Target Group Banner with 4 persona options
   - Dynamic content adaptation when persona is selected
3. **Proposed Changes**: 3-tier pricing (‚Ç¨99, ‚Ç¨149, ‚Ç¨199), simplified about page, persona-specific content
4. **Market Context**: Austrian/EU funding market, competitor analysis, mobile-first design
5. **GitHub Access**: Connect to the repository to understand existing codebase, colors, components, and structure

**KEY QUESTIONS TO ANSWER:**
1. What should we KEEP from current pricing and about pages?

4. How to optimize for Austrian/EU market?
5. What's the best mobile-first layout for pricing and about pages?
6. How to build trust without testimonials/partnerships?
7. What additional documents are needed per funding type and why?
8. What real add-ons deliver value (exclude API, white-label, team collaboration)?
9. How to explain jargon words so everyone understands?
10. What exact content should be on each page?

**FOCUS ON:**

- **Design specifications** using existing colors and components from GitHub
- **Product descriptions** with clear explanations for all 3 products
- **Document Packs** with detailed explanations of what and why
- **Add-ons** that deliver real value (exclude API, white-label, team collaboration)
- **Target group customization** for all 4 personas
- **Jargon-free explanations** for technical terms
