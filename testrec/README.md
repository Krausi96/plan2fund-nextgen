# Plan2Fund Enhancement Test Structure

This folder contains test implementations for enhancing the recommendation engine and editor based on the strategic documents.

## Current State Analysis

### âœ… What Already Exists:
- **Prefill System**: `src/lib/prefill.ts` - Basic prefill functionality
- **Decision Tree**: `src/lib/decisionTree.ts` - Rule-based decision tree
- **Enhanced Reco Engine**: `src/lib/enhancedRecoEngine.ts` - Advanced scoring
- **AI Helper**: `src/lib/aiHelper.ts` - AI assistance for editor
- **Dynamic Questions**: `src/lib/dynamicQuestionEngine.ts` - Dynamic question generation

### ðŸ”§ What We're Testing:
1. **Enhanced Requirements System** - Structured program requirements
2. **Improved Decision Tree** - Requirements-driven decision tree
3. **Better Editor Prefill** - Requirements-based editor prefill
4. **Readiness Check** - Automated completeness checking

## How to Use

1. **Start with Requirements**: Use the extraction tool to manually collect program requirements
2. **Test Decision Tree**: Run the enhanced decision tree with sample data
3. **Test Editor Prefill**: Verify that editor prefill works with requirements
4. **Test Readiness Check**: Ensure completeness checking works properly
5. **Integration Test**: Test the complete flow end-to-end

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Requirements Collection (Manual)
- Use the extraction tool to manually collect requirements for 5-10 key programs
- Focus on aws, FFG, major banks, and equity programs
- Validate the requirements structure

### Phase 2: Enhanced Decision Tree
- Test the enhanced decision tree with collected requirements
- Verify that it generates better questions and scoring
- Compare with existing decision tree

### Phase 3: Editor Prefill Enhancement
- Enhance existing prefill system with requirements data
- Test that editor sections are properly pre-filled
- Verify that missing information is clearly marked

### Phase 4: Readiness Check
- Implement readiness check based on requirements
- Test that it identifies missing information correctly
- Ensure it provides actionable suggestions

### Phase 5: Integration
- Test the complete flow from recommendation to editor
- Verify that all components work together
- Performance test with real data

## Next Steps

1. Start with the requirements extraction tool
2. Collect requirements for 3-5 key programs manually
3. Test the enhanced decision tree
4. Enhance the existing prefill system
5. Implement readiness check
6. Test integration

## Notes

- All tests are designed to work with your existing codebase
- No changes to existing files unless explicitly requested
- Focus on enhancing rather than replacing existing functionality
- Maintain backward compatibility
