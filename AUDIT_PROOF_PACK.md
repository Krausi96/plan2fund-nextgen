**System Version**: Current production state  
**Audit Scope**: User-side demos, System-side traces, Data freshness, Performance, Flags & Routes

---

## 1. USER-SIDE DEMOS

### ❌ **Proof 1.1: Wizard without Program Type**
**EXPECTED**: Wizard asks ~10 core questions, program/category emerges as outcome  
**CURRENT STATE**: 

```
Decision Tree Flow (src/lib/decisionTree.ts:37-47):
├── START: 'program_type' question (WRONG - conflicts with requirement)
├── "What type of funding are you looking for?"
├── Options: Grant/Loan/Equity/Visa/Mixed
└── THEN branches to eligibility questions
```

**EVIDENCE**: Decision tree code shows program type as first question
**COMPLIANCE**: ❌ FAILS - Program type asked upfront instead of inferred

---

### ❌ **Proof 1.2: AI Helper → Chips**  
**EXPECTED**: "CANVA AI BUSINESS PLAN" converts messy text into chips, feeds back into wizard  
**CURRENT STATE**:

```
AI Component Location: src/components/plan/AIChat.tsx
├── Available in: Plan Editor only
├── NOT available in: Wizard flow
├── Functionality: Basic chat with commands (/outline, /bullets, etc.)
└── Missing: Text → structured chips conversion
```

**EVIDENCE**: AIChat.tsx line 51-77 shows basic keyword extraction but not in wizard
**COMPLIANCE**: ❌ FAILS - AI help not inline with wizard, no chip generation

---

### ⚠️ **Proof 1.3: Simple Result Explanations**
**EXPECTED**: Program cards show % + "Why it fits" bullets + "Risks/Next steps" in plain language  
**CURRENT STATE**:

```
Current Results Display (pages/results.tsx:170-240):
├── Shows: Technical match scores, confidence levels
├── Shows: program.reason (technical explanation)  
├── Shows: Eligibility status, unmet requirements
└── Missing: Human-readable "Why it fits" bullets
```

**SAMPLE OUTPUT**:
```json
{
  "name": "AWS Innovation Fund",
  "score": 75,
  "reason": "✅ You meet all requirements for AWS Innovation Fund. Strong fit with score 75%.",
  "eligibility": "Eligible",
  "confidence": "High"
}
```

**COMPLIANCE**: ⚠️ PARTIAL - Shows scores but lacks human explanations

---

### ❌ **Proof 1.4: No-Match → QBank Flow**
**EXPECTED**: Show Nearest 3 + "what to change" + "Proceed anyway" → Editor with QBank  
**CURRENT STATE**:

```
Zero Match Fallback (src/components/fallback/ZeroMatchFallback.tsx):
├── Shows: Gap analysis and feedback options
├── Shows: Suggested programs with scores  
├── Missing: "Proceed anyway" button
└── Missing: QBank integration with Editor
```

**EVIDENCE**: ZeroMatchFallback component exists but no "Proceed anyway" flow to Editor
**COMPLIANCE**: ❌ FAILS - Missing QBank integration

---

## 2. SYSTEM-SIDE TRACES

### ❌ **Proof 2.1: Three Persona Rule Traces**
**EXPECTED**: B2C_FOUNDER, SME_LOAN, VISA personas showing inputs → rules → Match % → bullets

**B2C_FOUNDER Trace** (Simulated):
```
Input: {q1_country: "AT", q2_entity_stage: "PRE_COMPANY", q4_theme: ["INNOVATION_DIGITAL"]}
Rules Applied:
├── HARD: Country check (AT/EU) → ✅ PASS 
├── HARD: Stage check (PRE_COMPANY/INC_LT_6M) → ✅ PASS
├── SOFT: Innovation theme → ✅ PASS (+20%)
└── UNCERTAIN: Team diversity → ❓ SKIP
Final Score: 85%
Bullets: ["Austria location matches", "Perfect for pre-company stage", "Innovation focus aligned"]
```

**SME_LOAN Trace** (Current system cannot generate):
```
ERROR: No systematic rule tracing implemented
EVIDENCE: src/lib/recoEngine.ts has basic scoring but no trace logging
```

**COMPLIANCE**: ❌ FAILS - No rule traceability system exists

---

### ❌ **Proof 2.2: Decision Tree Regeneration**
**EXPECTED**: Before/after tree diff when program rule is edited  
**CURRENT STATE**:

```
Tree Generation: Hard-coded in src/lib/decisionTree.ts
├── Tree structure: Static node definitions
├── Rule changes: No automatic regeneration  
├── Information value: Not calculated
└── Question ordering: Manual, not optimized
```

**EVIDENCE**: Decision tree is hard-coded, not generated from program rules
**COMPLIANCE**: ❌ FAILS - No auto-compilation from rules

---

## 3. DATA FRESHNESS

### ❌ **Proof 3.1: Source Register for Top 20 Programs**
**EXPECTED**: URL, type (HTML/PDF/FAQ), extraction method, last-checked, hash, reviewer

**CURRENT STATE**: No source register exists

| Program ID | URL | Type | Method | Last Checked | Hash | Reviewer | Status |
|------------|-----|------|--------|-------------|------|-----------|---------|
| aws_preseed | ❌ No URL tracked | ❌ Unknown | ❌ Manual | ❌ Never | ❌ None | ❌ None | ❌ Unknown |
| umweltfoerderung | ❌ No URL tracked | ❌ Unknown | ❌ Manual | ❌ Never | ❌ None | ❌ None | ❌ Unknown |

**EVIDENCE**: No source tracking system in codebase
**COMPLIANCE**: ❌ FAILS - No source register exists

---

### ❌ **Proof 3.2: Data PR Diff Example**
**EXPECTED**: Diff bot proposes changes → PR review required

**CURRENT STATE**: 
```bash
$ ls scripts/
ci-schema-freshness.js  # Basic schema checking only
demo-intake.js
pr-automation.js       # Basic PR automation, not for data diffs
score.js
smoke.mjs
source-diff-fetcher.js # Exists but not integrated
test-parser.js
```

**EVIDENCE**: No automated data diff bot operational
**COMPLIANCE**: ❌ FAILS - No data freshness PR workflow

---

## 4. SKIP & UNCERTAINTY HANDLING

### ⚠️ **Proof 4.1: Skip Flow → Overlays → QBank**
**EXPECTED**: User skips → max 3 overlays → results → Editor QBank populated

**CURRENT SKIP HANDLING** (src/components/reco/Wizard.tsx:320-336):
```javascript
// Skip button exists:
<Button variant="ghost" size="sm" onClick={() => {
  const qId = currentQuestions[step].id;
  setAnswers((prev) => ({ 
    ...prev, 
    [qId]: null, 
    [`${qId}_skip_reason`]: "unknown" 
  }));
  // Continues to next question
}}>
  Skip / Don't know
</Button>
```

**MICRO-OVERLAY LOGIC** (lines 54-93):
```javascript
const computeMicroQuestions = (currentAnswers) => {
  // Calculates missing items
  // BUT: No cap of 3 overlays enforced
  // BUT: No QBank population
}
```

**COMPLIANCE**: ⚠️ PARTIAL - Skip works, but no overlay cap or QBank integration

---

## 5. PERFORMANCE

### ❌ **Proof 5.1: Latency Snapshot (P95 ≤ 2.5s)**
**EXPECTED**: Performance dashboard showing P95 ≤ 2.5s

**CURRENT STATE**: No performance monitoring exists

```bash
$ grep -r "performance\|latency\|P95" src/
# No results - no performance tracking implemented
```

**MANUAL TEST** (would require running server):
```bash
# API endpoint test
curl -w "%{time_total}\n" -s -o /dev/null \
  -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/recommend \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"answers":{"q1_country":"AT"}}'
# Result: Cannot verify without running system
```

**COMPLIANCE**: ❌ FAILS - No performance monitoring system

---

## 6. FLAGS & ROUTES

### ✅ **Proof 6.1: Current Feature Flags**
**SOURCE**: src/lib/featureFlags.ts

| Flag Name | Status | Description | Segments |
|-----------|---------|-------------|----------|
| RECO_DECISION_TREE | ✅ **ON** | Use decision tree logic for recommendations | All segments |
| AI_HELPER_ON | ❌ **OFF** | Enable AI helper (not defined in current flags) | N/A |
| EXPLAIN_SIMPLE_COPY | ❌ **OFF** | Enable simple explanations (not defined) | N/A |
| AI_DISCOVERY | ❌ **OFF** | AI discovery mode (not defined) | N/A |

| EDITOR_TEMPLATES_V1 | ✅ **ON** | Enable program-aware editor templates | All segments |
| ANALYTICS_AB | ✅ **ON** | Enable A/B testing and analytics | All segments |

**COMPLIANCE**: ⚠️ PARTIAL - Some required flags missing from specification

## CRITICAL GAPS REQUIRING IMMEDIATE ATTENTION

1. **❌ Wizard starts with program type** - Core requirement violation
2. **❌ No AI helper in wizard** - Missing key feature  
3. **❌ No rule traceability** - Cannot prove deterministic behavior
4. **❌ No data freshness system** - Cannot guarantee current information
5. **❌ No performance monitoring** - Cannot verify SLA compliance

**RECOMMENDATION**: System requires significant development work to meet audit specification.
