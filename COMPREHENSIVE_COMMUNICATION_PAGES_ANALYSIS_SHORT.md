# 📊 **COMMUNICATION PAGES ANALYSIS**

## 🎯 **TASK**
Analyze Plan2Fund's pricing and about pages and provide detailed design and architecture recommendations. The landing page is the source of truth and should NOT be changed.

## 🏠 **LANDING PAGE REFERENCE (Source of Truth)**
- **Standard Version** (`/`): Default with Solo-Entrepreneurs content
- **Target Group Banner**: 4 personas (Startups, SMEs, Advisors, Innovation Hubs)
- **Dynamic Content**: Adapts when persona is selected
- **Target Group Pages** (`/for/*`): Dedicated pages for each persona

## 💰 **CURRENT PRICING PAGE ISSUES**
- 3 products (Strategy €99, Review €149, Custom €299)
- Generic for all target groups
- Confusing add-ons
- Fake partners section
- Mobile issues with 3-card grid

## 📖 **CURRENT ABOUT PAGE ISSUES**
- 8 sections (too long)
- Fake team members and partners
- Fake stats and metrics
- Generic content, not persona-specific

## 🎯 **PROPOSED CHANGES**
- **Pricing**: Keep 3 products (€99, €149, €199) with better descriptions
- **About**: Reduce to 4 sections, remove fake content
- **Persona-specific**: Customize for 4 target groups
- **Document Packs**: Add detailed explanations of what and why
- **Add-ons**: Real value (exclude API, white-label, team collaboration)

## 🔍 **KEY QUESTIONS**
1. What should we KEEP from current pages?
2. What should we CHANGE in pricing structure?
3. How to make pages persona-specific for 4 target groups?
4. What additional documents are needed per funding type and why?
5. What real add-ons deliver value?
6. How to explain jargon words so everyone understands?
7. What exact content should be on each page?

## 🎯 **DELIVERABLES NEEDED**

## 🚀 **CONSTRAINTS**
- Solo founder (no fake team/partners)

- No code responses (analysis only)

**RESULT:** Clear, actionable recommendations for improving pricing and about pages while maintaining simplicity and clarity. Landing page remains unchanged as source of truth.
