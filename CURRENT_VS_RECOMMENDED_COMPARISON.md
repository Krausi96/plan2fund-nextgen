## Detailed Comparison

### 1. Data Management

**Current:**
```typescript
// Static data in programs.json
{
  "programs": [
    {
      "id": "aws_preseed_innovative_solutions",
      "name": "aws Preseed â€“ Innovative Solutions",
      "type": "grant",
      "eligibility": [...],
      "overlays": [...]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Recommended:**
```typescript
// Dynamic data from web scraper
interface ProgramData {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  type: FundingType;
  targetGroups: TargetGroup[];
  requirements: StructuredRequirements;
  documents: DocumentRequirements;
  scoring: ScoringRules;
  metadata: {
    lastUpdated: Date;
    source: string;
    confidence: number;
    changeLog: ChangeLog[];
  };
}
```

### 2. Recommendation Engine

**Current:**
```typescript
// Basic rule-based scoring
function scorePrograms(answers: UserAnswers, programs: any[]): ProgramScore[] {
  return programs.map(program => {
    let score = 0;
    // Simple rule matching
    if (answers.country === program.country) score += 20;
    if (answers.type === program.type) score += 30;
    // ... more basic rules
    return { program, score };
  });
}
```

**Recommended:**
```typescript
// Hybrid ML + Rules + LLM scoring
class EnhancedScoringEngine {
  async scorePrograms(answers: UserAnswers, programs: ProgramData[]): Promise<ProgramScore[]> {
    // 1. Rule-based scoring (fast, reliable)
    const ruleScores = this.calculateRuleScores(answers, programs);
    
    // 2. ML-based scoring (learns from user behavior)
    const mlScores = await this.calculateMLScores(answers, programs);
    
    // 3. LLM-enhanced reasoning (understands context)
    const llmScores = await this.calculateLLMScores(answers, programs);
    
    // 4. Combine with confidence weighting
    return this.combineScores(ruleScores, mlScores, llmScores);
  }
}
```

### 3. Question Generation

**Current:**
```typescript
// Static question set
const questions = [
  { id: 'q1_country', question: 'What is your country?', type: 'select' },
  { id: 'q2_entity_stage', question: 'What is your entity stage?', type: 'select' },
  // ... fixed questions
];
```

**Recommended:**
```typescript
// Dynamic question generation
class DynamicQuestionGenerator {
  generateQuestions(programs: ProgramData[]): Question[] {
    // 1. Extract requirements from all programs
    const requirements = this.extractCommonRequirements(programs);
    
    // 2. Generate questions based on requirements
    const questions = this.generateQuestionsFromRequirements(requirements);
    
    // 3. Optimize question order for maximum efficiency
    return this.optimizeQuestionOrder(questions);
  }
}
```

### 4. Data Coverage

**Current:**
- Austrian programs only
- 214 programs
- Manual data entry
- Static requirements

**Recommended:**
- Austrian + EU + Bank + Visa programs
- 500+ programs
- Automated data collection
- Dynamic requirements

### 5. Target Group Support

**Current:**
```typescript
// Basic target group detection
const targetGroups = ['startups', 'sme', 'advisors', 'universities'];
```

**Recommended:**
```typescript
// Full personalization per target group
interface TargetGroupConfig {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  products: Product[];
  documents: DocumentRequirements;
  scoring: ScoringWeights;
  questions: Question[];
  editorSections: EditorSection[];
  pricing: PricingTier[];
}
```

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-4)
- [ ] Create web scraper architecture
- [ ] Implement basic scrapers for Austrian programs
- [ ] Enhance current recommendation engine
- [ ] Add LLM integration for requirement extraction

### Phase 2: Enhancement (Weeks 5-8)
- [ ] Implement full web scraping system
- [ ] Add EU program coverage
- [ ] Implement dynamic question generation
- [ ] Add real-time data updates

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Weeks 9-12)

- [ ] Add change detection and notifications
- [ ] Optimize performance and caching

## Expected Outcomes

### User Experience
- **2x+ more programs** available
- **Real-time updates** ensure current information
- **Personalized recommendations** per target group
- **Dynamic questions** always relevant
- **Accurate matching** with hybrid scoring

### Business Impact
- **Reduced maintenance** costs (automated updates)
- **Higher conversion** rates (better recommendations)
- **Competitive advantage** (most comprehensive database)
- **Scalable growth** (easy to add new sources)

### Technical Benefits
- **Maintainable code** with modular architecture
- **Extensible system** for new features
- **Data quality** with automated validation
- **Performance** with efficient processing

## Conclusion

The recommended system represents a **complete transformation** from a static, manual system to a **dynamic, AI-powered platform** that:

1. **Automatically collects** data from all relevant sources
2. **Intelligently processes** requirements using LLM
3. **Dynamically generates** questions and recommendations
4. **Personalizes experiences** for each target group
5. **Stays current** with real-time updates

This will position Plan2Fund as the **most comprehensive and intelligent** funding platform in Austria and the EU.
