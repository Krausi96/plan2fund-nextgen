# Pipeline Unification - Complete ✅

## Status: Pipeline Fully Unified

The data pipeline has been successfully unified and simplified. All phases are complete.

## What Was Done

### Unified Filtering Architecture
- **Single Source of Truth**: QuestionEngine filters programs progressively as user answers
- **No Duplicate Filtering**: EnhancedRecoEngine receives pre-filtered programs from QuestionEngine
- **Better Performance**: Programs filtered once, not twice

### Changes Made

#### 1. EnhancedRecoEngine.ts
Added optional `preFilteredPrograms` parameter to accept pre-filtered programs:
```typescript
export async function scoreProgramsEnhanced(
  answers: UserAnswers,
  mode: "strict" | "explorer" = "strict",
  preFilteredPrograms?: Program[] // NEW: Optional pre-filtered programs
)
```

#### 2. SmartWizard.tsx
Passes filtered programs from QuestionEngine to EnhancedRecoEngine:
```typescript
const remainingPrograms = questionEngine.getRemainingPrograms();
const results = await scoreProgramsEnhanced(answers, "strict", remainingPrograms);
```

## The Unified Flow

```
1. Web Scraper → Scrapes 503 programs → Saves to JSON
2. API → Serves programs via /api/programs
3. Wizard → Creates QuestionEngine(programs)
4. Progressive Filtering → QuestionEngine filters as user answers
5. Final Scoring → EnhancedRecoEngine scores pre-filtered programs
6. Results → Display to user
```

## Benefits

✅ No duplicate filtering  
✅ Single source of truth (QuestionEngine)  
✅ Faster performance  
✅ Easier to maintain  
✅ Cleaner code  
✅ Backward compatible (advanced search unaffected)

## Files Modified

- `src/lib/enhancedRecoEngine.ts` - Added preFilteredPrograms parameter
- `src/components/wizard/SmartWizard.tsx` - Passes filtered programs

## Testing

- ✅ No linter errors
- ✅ Backward compatible
- ✅ Wizard flow tested
- ✅ Advanced search unaffected

## Current Architecture

### Data Flow
```
Web Scraper (503 programs)
    ↓
JSON Storage (data/scraped-programs-2025-10-23.json)
    ↓
API Endpoint (pages/api/programs.ts)
    ↓
QuestionEngine (progressive filtering)
    ↓
EnhancedRecoEngine (scoring with pre-filtered programs)
    ↓
Results Display
```

### Key Components
- **webScraperService.ts**: Scrapes and stores programs
- **QuestionEngine**: Dynamic question generation and progressive filtering
- **EnhancedRecoEngine**: Scoring with optional pre-filtered programs
- **SmartWizard**: UI orchestrator

## Maintenance

All code is production-ready. The pipeline is now:
- Simplified: Removed duplicate filtering
- Fast: Programs filtered once
- Maintainable: Single source of truth
- Scalable: Easy to extend
