# Extraction Analysis & Next Steps

## ‚úÖ What Was Fixed

### 1. Funding Amount Extraction
**Changes Made**:
- Enhanced `extractStructuredData()` to accept cheerio `$` object for DOM navigation
- Extract text from body (removes script/style tags)
- Search specific HTML elements (`.amount`, `.funding-amount`, tables, definition lists)
- Enhanced regex patterns (German/English formats, millions, various separators)
- Better number parsing (handles spaces, commas, dots as thousands/decimal)
- Range validation (0 - 100M EUR)

### 2. Deadline Extraction
**Changes Made**:
- Search deadline-specific HTML elements (`.deadline`, `.frist`, tables)
- Enhanced regex patterns (more German keywords, flexible date formats)
- Date validation (only future dates, reasonable range)
- Better context matching (dates near deadline keywords)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Results

**Problem**: Fixes applied but results show 0% funding amounts still

**Why?**:
- Scraper ran but **no new programs scraped** (all skipped - scraped < 24h ago)
- Existing 80 programs were scraped BEFORE the fixes
- Need to scrape NEW programs to see improvement

**Scraper Output**:
- Processed institutions but many URLs were **skipped** (already scraped)
- Some URLs were **rejected** as listing pages (validation working correctly)
- Total: Still 80 programs (no new ones scraped)

---

## üìä Observations from Scraper Run

### Issues Found:

1. **Many URLs Skipped (Already Scraped)**
   - Change detection working: skips URLs scraped < 24h
   - Need to either:
     - Wait 24h+ and re-run
     - Scrape NEW URLs from discovery state (394 available)

2. **Some URLs Rejected as Listing Pages**
   - Validation correctly filtering out category pages
   - Example: `https://www.fwf.ac.at/foerdern/foerderportfolio/themenfoerderungen/europaeische-partnerschaft-futurefoods`
   - This is good - prevents scraping wrong pages

3. **Discovery State Still Has 358 Unscraped URLs**
   - These are ready to scrape
   - But scraper only processes 15 per institution in cycle mode
   - Some institutions have 0 unscraped (already processed)

---

## üîç Why Extraction Still Shows 0%

**Current Data**: All 80 programs scraped BEFORE fixes were applied

**To Test Fixes**:
1. Need to scrape programs that weren't scraped before (or wait 24h)
2. OR delete some programs from JSON and re-scrape them
3. OR scrape the 394 new URLs from discovery

---

## üéØ Proposed Next Steps

### Option 1: Scrape NEW URLs (Recommended)
**Action**: Force scrape the 358 unscraped URLs even if they're category pages
**Problem**: Some might be listing pages (will be skipped by validation anyway)

**Better**: Run discovery to find MORE actual detail pages, then scrape

### Option 2: Re-scrape a Sample (Test Fix)
**Action**: Delete 5-10 programs from JSON, then re-run scraper
**Benefit**: See if extraction improvements work
**Time**: ~5 minutes

### Option 3: Wait & Re-scrape (Natural Flow)
**Action**: Wait 24h+ then re-run scraper
**Benefit**: Natural change detection flow
**Problem**: Slow, don't see if fixes work

---

## üìã Recommended Immediate Actions

### 1. **Test Extraction on Sample Programs** (5 min)
```bash
# Create test script that:
# - Picks 5 programs with known funding amounts
# - Re-scrapes them with new extraction logic
# - Compares results
```

### 2. **Run Deep Discovery** (30 min)
**Action**: `node scripts/run-discovery-only.js deep`
**Why**: Find more actual detail pages (not category pages)
**Expected**: Find 500-1000 more scrapable URLs

### 3. **Scrape Fresh URLs** (10 min)
**Action**: After discovery, scrape the new URLs
**Why**: These weren't scraped before, so will use new extraction logic
**Expected**: See if funding amounts/deadlines improve

---

## üéØ Expected Improvements After Fixes

**Before**:
- Funding Amounts: 0%
- Deadlines: 18.8%

**After (Expected)**:
- Funding Amounts: 30-50% (many programs don't list amounts on page)
- Deadlines: 40-60% (more flexible patterns)

**Note**: Some programs genuinely don't have amounts/deadlines on their pages - 100% extraction isn't realistic

---

## üí° Key Insight

The fixes are **code-level improvements** but need **fresh scraped data** to see results.

Current database = old scraped data (before fixes)
Need = new scraped data (after fixes) to measure improvement

---

## üîß Alternative: Force Re-scrape Script

Create a script that:
1. Backs up current scraped programs
2. Deletes programs from specific institutions
3. Re-runs scraper
4. Compares old vs new extraction results

This would prove the fixes work without waiting 24h.
