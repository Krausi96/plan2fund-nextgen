- **Serverless Functions**: Vercel for Airtable integration and Stripe webhooks
- **Payments**: Stripe Checkout for immediate monetization
- **File Storage**: Airtable attachments or AWS S3 for future file uploads
- **Analytics**: Google Analytics or Plausible for usage tracking

### **WHY AIRTABLE OVER SUPABASE:**
- **Setup Complexity**: Very low - just create tables via GUI, no server setup
- **Data Accessibility**: Excellent for non-tech founder - data visible as spreadsheet
- **Multi-user Support**: Yes - all data in cloud, accessible from any device
- **Maintenance**: Very low - essentially no maintenance, UI-driven updates
- **Integration**: REST API and no-code integrations (Zapier, etc.)
- **Cost**: Free for small usage (up to 1200 records), scales affordably

### **SECURITY & GDPR:**
- User data stored on US-based cloud (Airtable) - mention in privacy policy
- Each plan tied to session ID for access control
- API endpoints filter by session ID to prevent cross-user access
- Minimal personal data collection (email on payment only)

## **SUCCESS METRICS TO TRACK**

- **Recommendation Quality**: % of users who find relevant programs
- **Editor Completion**: % of users who complete their business plans
- **AI Satisfaction**: User ratings of AI assistance quality
- **Conversion Rates**: Free to paid conversion by segment
- **Feature Usage**: Which features are most/least used
- **User Retention**: How many users come back and complete plans

## **CRITICAL REALITY CHECK**

This analysis reveals that while the basic structure exists with sophisticated features like:
- Advanced scoring algorithms with 4-component weighting
- Real Austrian program database with detailed eligibility criteria
- Comprehensive editor with version control, chart generation, and style customization
- Title page generation and subchapter tracking

The system still lacks the **intelligence, localization, and user experience** needed for market success. GPT needs to focus on:

1. **Making the AI actually intelligent** (replace mock responses with OpenAI API)
2. **Making recommendations actually relevant** (implement decision tree logic)
3. **Making the editor actually helpful** (add program-specific guidance and export functionality)
4. **Making it Austrian-specific** (German localization, local market positioning)
5. **Making it market-ready** (payment integration, legal compliance, trust elements)

The current state is more of a **sophisticated prototype** than a market-ready product, but the foundation is solid for rapid development.
