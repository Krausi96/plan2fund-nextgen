# GPT Analysis Prompt - Plan2Fund Categorization System

You are a funding program categorization expert. Analyze and improve our categorization system.

## PROJECT OVERVIEW
Plan2Fund - AI-powered funding recommendation platform for Austrian companies in EU/Austrian market.

## CURRENT PROBLEM
Our 10 categories are mostly EMPTY (only 2-3 categories have data per program). We need to identify what requirements to parse in Layer 1 and how to categorize them in Layer 2.

## DOCUMENTATION TO READ
- `docs/architecture/GPT_ARCHITECTURE_SUMMARY.md` - Complete system architecture, frontend components, layer structure, and all files

## TASK SEQUENCE
1. Read the architecture summary to understand the complete system
2. Analyze the frontend components and their data requirements
3. Review all layers and how they serve each other
4. Research funding program categorization best practices for Austrian companies
5. Return: Enhanced categorization algorithm (code instructions, no actual code)

## FOCUS AREAS
- What requirements to parse in Layer 1 (enhanced extraction patterns)
- How to categorize them in Layer 2 (improved categorization algorithm)
- How to make categorization dynamic and expandable
- Missing business categories (IMPACT, CAPEX/OPEX, USE_OF_FUNDS, etc.)
- URL discovery and requirements parsing enhancement

## EXPECTED OUTPUT
File with complete system improvement plan and code instructions for enhanced categorization.
