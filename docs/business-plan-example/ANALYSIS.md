## Critical Reassessment: Priority 1 & 2

### Priority 1: BLOCKERS (Must Have to Complete Plan)

#### 1. Financial Tables & Charts Generator ⚠️ CRITICAL
**Why:** The Runtastic plan has extensive financial sections with:
- Multi-year revenue/cost projections
- Break-even analysis
- Cash flow projections
- Multiple scenarios

**User Input Connection:**
- User enters financial data in tables
- System generates charts automatically
- Charts appear in preview/export

**What's Needed:**
- Enhanced table editor (already exists but needs improvement)
- Chart generation from table data (Bar, Line charts)
- Scenario management (base/worst/best case)
- Export charts to PDF

**Current State:** Basic table editing exists, but no chart generation

#### 2. Requirements Modal Enhancement ⚠️ CRITICAL
**Why:** Users need to see:
- All sections overview
- Missing requirements per section
- Program-specific requirements checklist
- Progress across entire plan

**User Input Connection:**
- User sees what's missing
- Can generate missing content directly from modal
- Validates against program requirements

**Current State:** Basic progress display exists

#### 3. Export/Preview Enhancement ⚠️ CRITICAL
**Why:** Users need to:
- Export to PDF with all charts/tables
- Preview final document
- See professional formatting

**User Input Connection:**
- User clicks "Export" → gets complete PDF
- Charts/tables included in export
- Professional formatting

**Current State:** Preview exists, export needs enhancement

### Priority 2: ENHANCERS (Improve Quality)

#### 4. Settings Modal - Document Formatting
**Why:** Professional appearance matters
**Features:**

- Page numbering
- Font/formatting options
- Cover page design

#### 5. Validation System

- Suggest improvements

#### 6. Chart Generator (Basic)
**Why:** Visual data presentation
**Features:**

### Priority 3: NICE-TO-HAVE (Can Wait)

## Revised Priority List

### Priority 1: BLOCKERS (Complete These First)
1. **Financial Tables & Charts** - Generate charts from table data
2. **Requirements Modal** - All sections overview, missing items, generate missing content
3. **Export Enhancement** - PDF export with charts/tables, professional formatting

### Priority 2: ENHANCERS (Improve Quality)
4. **Settings Modal** - Document formatting, title page, styling
5. **Validation System** - Auto-check against program requirements
6. **Basic Chart Generator** - Bar/Line charts from financial data

### Priority 3: NICE-TO-HAVE (Later)
7. Citations Manager
8. Documents Panel
9. Advanced Chart Types

## User Workflow Connection

### How Features Connect to User Input:

1. **User enters financial data** → Tables store data → Charts auto-generate → Appears in preview/export
2. **User writes sections** → Requirements modal shows progress → Highlights missing items → Can generate missing content
3. **User completes plan** → Export to PDF → Includes all charts/tables → Professional formatting

### Critical Path:
```
User Input → Tables/Charts → Validation → Export
     ↓            ↓              ↓          ↓
  Text Editor  Chart Gen    Requirements  PDF Export
```

## Key Decisions

1. **Charts are ESSENTIAL** - Not nice-to-have, they're critical for financial sections
2. **Multiple scenarios** - Users need base/worst/best case projections
3. **Export quality** - PDF must include charts/tables professionally formatted
4. **Requirements validation** - Must check against program requirements automatically
