- Test state synchronization between steps
- Test change tracking (confirm/cancel)
- Test overlay positioning

### E2E Tests
- Test 3-step configuration flow
- **Test program connection via all methods** (CRITICAL)

- Test requirements checking (with connected program)
- Test section/document toggling
- Test section reordering
- **Test new documents don't inherit core product sections** (CRITICAL)

### Regression Tests
- Verify all completed fixes still work (Phase 0)
- Test hydration issues don't return
- Test navigation suppression still works
- Test form cutoff fix still works

---

## 🚨 Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Areas
1. **Program Connection (Phase 2.1 - CRITICAL)**
   - Risk: Program connection not working blocks other features
   - Mitigation: Fix this first, test thoroughly, verify program sections are added

2. **Component Splitting (Phase 1 - Complete)**
   - Risk: Breaking state synchronization
   - Status: ✅ Complete - no issues reported

3. **useEffect Dependencies**
   - Risk: Infinite loops or missed updates
   - Mitigation: Careful dependency analysis, use ESLint rules, thorough testing

### Medium-Risk Areas
1. **New Documents/Sections Issue (Phase 2.2 - CRITICAL)**
   - Risk: New documents inheriting core product sections breaks user expectations
   - Mitigation: Fix in all components, test thoroughly, verify section-document relationships

2. **Section Reordering (Phase 2.5)**
   - Risk: Order not persisting or syncing incorrectly
   - Mitigation: Save to metadata, test persistence, handle edge cases

3. **Requirements Display (Phase 2.3)**
   - Risk: Depends on program connection working
   - Mitigation: Fix program connection first, then enhance requirements

---

## 📝 Decision Log

### Decisions Needed
1. **Program Connection:** What's broken? → **Action: Investigate and fix (Phase 2.1)**
2. **Product Finder:** Build now or wait? → **Decision: Wait for more products (short-term: improve tooltips)**
3. **Section Keywords:** Format? → **Decision: `string[]` array**
4. **Reordering Library:** Which one? → **Decision: `@dnd-kit` (modern, accessible)**
5. **Program Sections:** Removable or always kept? → **Decision: Keep as custom when disconnected**
6. **Section Editing:** Inline or form? → **Decision: Form for metadata, inline for quick edits**
7. **Custom Products:** Build now or later? → **Decision: TBD based on user demand**
8. **Program Section Management:** Is this needed? → **Decision: Only if program connection works and sections are added**
