# Wiring Fixes Applied ✅

## Changes Made

### 1. SmartWizard Now Routes to /results ✅

**File:** `src/components/wizard/SmartWizard.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Added `useRecommendation()` hook import
- Added `useRouter()` hook import  
- Added `setRecommendations()` and `router` variables
- In `processResults()`:
  - Calls `setRecommendations(results)` to store in context
  - Calls `router.push('/results')` to navigate to results page

**Result:** Wizard results now stored in context AND navigates to /results page ✅

### 2. Results Page Now Has Fallback ✅

**File:** `pages/results.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Check both context AND localStorage for results
- Prioritizes context results
- Falls back to localStorage if context is empty

**Result:** Results page works for both wizard AND advanced search ✅

### 3. Advanced Search Status ✅

**Verified:** Advanced search already works correctly:
- Uses `advancedSearchDoctor` for parsing
- Stores results in context via `handleAdvancedSearch()`
- Navigation handled by user clicking "View All Results" button
- Results page reads from context

**No changes needed** ✅

## New Flow

### Wizard Flow (Fixed)
```
1. User completes wizard → processResults()
2. Gets remainingPrograms from QuestionEngine
3. Scores programs with pre-filtered data ✅
4. Calls setRecommendations(results) → stores in context ✅
5. Calls router.push('/results') → navigates automatically ✅
6. /results page reads from context ✅
7. Results displayed ✅
```

### Advanced Search Flow (Already Works)
```
1. User enters query → handleAdvancedSearch()
2. Parses with advancedSearchDoctor
3. Scores programs (all programs, no pre-filtering)
4. Stores in context ✅
5. Shows preview on /advanced-search
6. User clicks "View All Results"
7. Navigates to /results
8. Results page reads from context ✅
9. Results displayed ✅
```

## Summary

### Fixed:
- ✅ SmartWizard stores results in context
- ✅ SmartWizard navigates to /results automatically
- ✅ Results page checks both context and localStorage

### Already Working:
- ✅ Advanced search stores in context
- ✅ Advanced search navigation works

### Differences:
- **Wizard**: Uses pre-filtered programs (more accurate)
- **Advanced Search**: Scores all programs (broader search)

Both approaches are valid for their use cases!

## Testing

Test both flows:
1. ✅ Start wizard → Complete → Should auto-navigate to /results
2. ✅ Start advanced search → Submit → Click button → Should show results
3. ✅ Verify results display correctly
4. ✅ Check browser console for errors
