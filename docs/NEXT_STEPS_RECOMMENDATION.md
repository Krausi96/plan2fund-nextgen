# Next Steps Recommendation

## What I Learned

### The Pipeline (Complete)
```
Scraper → JSON Files → dataSource → /api/programs → QuestionEngine → SmartWizard → User → enhancedRecoEngine → Results
```

### Current State
- **Data flows correctly** from scraper to API
- **Questions are generated** from eligibility_criteria
- **User answers questions** in order
- **Programs are scored** at the end using all answers

### The REAL Problem
1. **Questions are static** - Generated once from ALL programs, not dynamically
2. **No progressive filtering** - Programs filtered at END, not during questions  
3. **No feedback to user** - User doesn't see how answers affect program pool
4. **Linear questioning** - Same questions for everyone

## What I Changed

### 1. Improved Question Selection
- Added scoring algorithm to pick BEST next question
- Questions now scored by information value
- Still not fully conditional (most questions have no skipConditions)

### 2. Added Progressive Filtering Logic
- Stop asking when ≤15 programs remain (NEW)
- Filter programs after each answer
- Log program counts to console

### 3. Added Conditional Logic Framework
- `shouldShowQuestion()` - checks skipConditions
- `calculateInformationValue()` - scores questions by effectiveness

## What Still Needs to Be Done

### Option A: Show Program Counts in UI
**Impact:** High UX improvement, easy to implement
```typescript
// Show user: "45 programs match your profile so far"
// After each answer, update this count
```

### Option B: Make Questions Truly Conditional  
**Impact:** Medium, requires more work
- Add skipConditions to ALL questions
- Generate questions based on remaining programs
- Different question trees for different user types

### Option C: Dynamic Question Generation
**Impact:** High, complex but powerful
- Generate new questions based on remaining programs
- Each question tailored to what's left in the pool
- True conditional branching

## My Recommendation

### Phase 1: Quick Win (30 min)
Add program count display to SmartWizard:
- Show "XX programs match your profile"
- Update after each answer
- Builds trust, shows progress

### Phase 2: Improve Conditional Logic (2 hours)
- Add skipConditions to ALL questions
- Test different user paths
- Make sure conditional questions work

### Phase 3: Advanced Optimization (4+ hours)
- Dynamic question generation
- Question trees for different user personas
- Machine learning for question effectiveness

## Your Decision

Which do you want me to implement next?
1. Phase 1 (UI feedback on program counts) - Easy
2. Phase 2 (Full conditional logic) - Medium
3. Phase 3 (Dynamic generation) - Hard
4. Stop and test what I have - Conservative

I believe the changes I've made so far will already improve question selection quality, even if not fully conditional yet.
