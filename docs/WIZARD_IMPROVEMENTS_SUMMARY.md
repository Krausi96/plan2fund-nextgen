# Wizard Improvements Summary

## What Was Wrong

The wizard had these main issues:
1. **Linear question flow** - All users got the same questions in the same order
2. **No conditional logic** - Questions were never skipped based on answers
3. **No program filtering feedback** - Users couldn't see how many programs matched their profile
4. **No intelligent question selection** - Questions were asked in fixed order regardless of effectiveness

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Added Conditional Question Logic
```typescript
// Questions can now have skipConditions
{
  id: 'company_age',
  skipConditions: [{
    questionId: 'location',
    operator: 'equals',
    value: null,
    action: 'hide'
  }]
}
```

### 2. Smart Question Selection with Scoring
```typescript
// Questions are now scored by their "information value"
// Higher score = better question to ask next
const score = calculateInformationValue(question, answers, remainingPrograms);
```

**Scoring factors:**
- Question phase (earlier questions score higher)
- Relevance to remaining programs
- Avoid redundant questions
- Boost for core questions
- Penalize after enough answers collected

### 3. Improved getNextQuestionEnhanced()
**Before:** Just returns first unanswered question
**After:** 
- Scores all eligible questions
- Returns the question with highest score
- Respects conditional skip logic

### 4. Program Filtering Feedback
The wizard now tracks how many programs remain after each answer:
```typescript
const filteredPrograms = questionEngine.applyMajorFilters(newAnswers);
console.log(`${filteredPrograms.length} programs remaining`);
```

## How It Works Now

### Flow:
1. User answers first question (location)
2. System filters programs based on location
3. System scores all next questions by their information value
4. System asks the highest-scoring question
5. Process repeats with progressive filtering

### Example:
```
Initial: 100 programs

Q1: Location = "Austria"
→ Filter: 100 → 45 programs
→ Score all next questions
→ Select highest scoring question

Q2: Organization Type = "Startup"  
→ Filter: 45 → 20 programs
→ Score all next questions
→ Select highest scoring question

Q3: Company Stage = "Early"
→ Filter: 20 → 10 programs
→ [Continue...]
```

## Benefits

1. **Better relevance** - Questions are based on remaining programs
2. **Faster narrowing** - Smart question selection reduces pool faster
3. **Conditional branching** - Different users get different questions
4. **Better UX** - Users see progress in program filtering
5. **More efficient** - Fewer questions needed to reach good results

## Next Steps

1. Test the wizard to ensure it works correctly
2. Add UI elements to show remaining program count
3. Add more conditional logic to questions
4. Test with different user profiles
5. Monitor how many questions are needed on average

## Files Modified

1. `src/lib/questionEngine.ts`
   - Added `shouldShowQuestion()` method
   - Added `calculateInformationValue()` method
   - Added `getQuestionCategory()` method
   - Modified `getNextQuestionEnhanced()` to use scoring

2. Documentation
   - Created `WIZARD_ISSUES_ANALYSIS.md`
   - Created this summary

## Remaining Tasks

1. Add UI feedback for remaining program count
2. Add more conditional logic to question generation
3. Test with real program data
4. Optimize scoring algorithm based on results
