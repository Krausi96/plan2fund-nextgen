## 🎯 User Experience

### Live Interface
- **URL**: `http://localhost:3000/reco`
- **Dynamic Questions**: 10 comprehensive questions covering all aspects
- **Real-time Matching**: Instant program recommendations
- **Transparent Scoring**: Shows why programs match and what risks exist

### Recommendation Quality
- **Scoring System**: Rule-based with hard/soft matching
- **Risk Assessment**: Identifies potential mismatches
- **Reasoning**: Clear explanations for each recommendation
- **Coverage**: 91% ensures comprehensive matching

## 🔍 System Transparency

### Data Flow
```
User Input → Question Engine → Answer Processing → Program Matching → Recommendations
```

### Decision Logic
1. **Input Validation**: All required questions answered
2. **Rule Matching**: Evaluate overlays against user answers
3. **Scoring**: Hard rules (+20), soft rules (+10), bonuses (+15/+10)
4. **Ranking**: Sort by score, return top 5
5. **Risk Assessment**: Identify non-matching hard rules

### Traceability
- **Every recommendation** can be traced back to specific rules
- **User inputs** are mapped to program overlays
- **Scoring decisions** are transparent and documented
- **Risk factors** are clearly identified

## 🚀 CI/CD Integration

### Coverage Validation
- **Threshold**: 80% minimum coverage
- **Current**: 91% (exceeds threshold)
- **Validation**: Runs on every update
- **Failure**: CI fails if coverage drops below 80%

### Quality Assurance
- **Program Validation**: All programs have comprehensive overlays
- **Field Coverage**: All question fields covered
- **Rule Quality**: Hard/soft rule classification
- **Data Integrity**: Consistent program structure

## 📈 Performance

### System Performance
- **Program Evaluation**: 214 programs processed
- **Rule Evaluation**: 1710 rules per persona test
- **Response Time**: Sub-second recommendation generation
